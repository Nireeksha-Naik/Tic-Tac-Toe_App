# Tic-Tac-Toe_App
Tic-tac-toe is a simple, two-player game where players take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or an "O". The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
